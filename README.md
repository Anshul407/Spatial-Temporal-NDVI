## Project Description:
This project focuses on utilizing satellite imagery data to monitor vegetation health by calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Leveraging Google Earth Engine's code editor, the project enables efficient processing of Landsat 8 satellite data to visualize and analyze vegetation conditions across selected regions.
## Team Members:
- Anshul Kunwar (22BAI70013)
- Aditya (22BAI70800)
- Modini Bhardwaj (22BAI70773)
- Akanksha Sharma (22BIT70077)

## Supervisor:
Mrs. Kirti
(Assistant Professor)

## Methodology:
1. **NDVI Computation**:NDVI is calculated to assess the health and density of vegetation based on satellite imagery.
2. **Time-Series Analysis / Spatial Visualization**: Visualizing NDVI variations over time or across different geographic areas using Landsat 8 data.
3. **Web Application Deployment**: The project is deployed as a user-friendly web application for easy access and visualization of results.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the provided Google Earth Engine code to calculate NDVI, NDWI and estimate pH values.
3. Follow deployment instructions to host the web application.
